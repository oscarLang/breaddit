# Breaddit
This website was made as the final project for the course”DV1610 Webbaserade ramverk och designmönster”, also known as Ramverk1. The main object of the site was to create a forum similar to the one in stackoverflow. I decided to also take a lot of inspiration from the site reddit.com, especially when designing the commentary system.

## Installation
Fork or checkout the repo into your local system. Then run `sql/ddl.sqlite`
and `sql/user_sqlite.sqlite` to set up the database.
