About
=========================

This website was made as the final project for the course"DV1610 Webbaserade ramverk och designm√∂nster", also known as Ramverk1. The main object of the site was to create a forum similar to the one in [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com). I decided to also take a lot of inspiration from the site [reddit.com](reddit.com), especially when designing the commentary system.

####About me
My name is Oscar Lang and I am a student enrolled on the program webbprogrammering at BTH.
